Juan Hit Wonder (2D,Fast-paced, Top-down, Hack & Slash game)

Juan Hit Wonder is an fast-paced, top-down hack & slash game 
where the player has to control a hero to defeat endless 
waves of enemies and 2 boss enemies. The objective of the game 
is to defeat as many waves of enemies as possible while 
avoiding hazardous terrain, and collecting gold dropped by enemies 
to buy upgrades.

The main character, Juan, was asked to act as a Hero for a player 
where you destroy monsters to save the day. However, Juan took the 
role too seriously and really believed that he was a hero of the people.

Clear 30 waves of enemies and 3 bosses to make it out of the arena alive 
and save the world from impending doom…. 
Even though you are big and roly-poly, move as swift as a ninja while 
you dash and strike enemies with your sword, while avoiding waves 
of enemies and boss monsters that are coming for you. 
Either you die a hero, or live to be a one-hit wonder.
